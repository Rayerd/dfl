The DFL library is under a 3-choice license.
You may choose any of the below based on your use of the code.

License Choice 1)
    LGPL (GNU Lesser General Public License) described in lgpl.txt

License Choice 2)
    zlib license (libpng/zlib license) described in zlib.txt may be
    used if the code in no way depends on the Windows Win32 API.
    This allows the code to be translated to another API.

License Choice 3)
    Unmodified versions of the DFL library obtained directly from the
    official DFL package at http://www.dprogramming.com/dfl.php may
    be used, including redistributions in source or binary form and
    commercial applications, subject to the following:

        implied warranty. In no event will the authors be held liable
        for any damages arising from the use of this software.
        
        3b) The origin of this software must not be misrepresented;
        you must not claim that you wrote the original software.
        
        3c) Source redistributions must include the DFL license
        in the source code directory, and the above copyright notice
        and official software website address must be included in
        supporting documentation.
        
        3d) For source redistributions, any accompanying files not
        from the original package must reside in separate file
        directories.

source code is compiled.

"Win32 API" refers to the Microsoft Windows API, including Win32 for
64-bit Windows (Win64), or any of the user32, kernel32 or gdi32 DLLs
